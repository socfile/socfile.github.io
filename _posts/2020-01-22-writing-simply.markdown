The first step[^1] of writing clearly is to write honestly. To write honestly, you need to be open to yourself and your readers why you write. When your goals for writing become clear, you can start to think how you can accomplish them.

In his essay *Politics and English Language*[^2], George Orwell (1946) says that "the great enemy of clear language is insincerity". If there's a gap between your real and your declared aims, Orwell continues, your writing will be "like a cuttlefish squirting out ink". You are not really sure what you want to say and how to say it. 

The point is, you are not making yourself clear. Not to yourself, not to your readers.

**What you want to say?**

What is your goal? Why are you writing? 

By writing, we usually want to have some kind of effect to our readers. The reason I'm writing about writing clearly, is that I want to teach to myself and my readers, how to do it. Before you start writing, think why you are doing it.

**How to do it?**

When you have your goals and the effects you want to make clear in your mind, think how you will achieve them. You want to write so clearly that your readers will have no hard times understanding you.

You want to choose your words right. You've to think what words are the best ones for you message. You want to use examples, idioms and images to clear any misunderstanding the reader may have.

**Write honestly**

Just be honest to yourself and your reader. Be sincere. Don’t claim to know what you don't know. Like Orwell, you are free to say “this is a guess which I have not sufficient knowledge to verify” when you really don't know.
